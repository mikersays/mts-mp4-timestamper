# Project Workflow

## Guiding Principles

1. **The Plan is the Source of Truth:** All work must be tracked in `plan.md`
2. **The Tech Stack is Deliberate:** Changes to the tech stack must be documented in `tech-stack.md` *before* implementation
3. **Test-Driven Development:** Write unit tests before implementing functionality
4. **High Code Coverage:** Aim for >80% code coverage for all modules
5. **User Experience First:** Every decision should prioritize user experience
6. **Non-Interactive & CI-Aware:** Prefer non-interactive commands. Use `CI=true` for watch-mode tools (tests, linters) to ensure single execution.

## Task Workflow

All tasks follow a strict lifecycle:

### Standard Task Workflow

1. **Select Task:** Choose the next available task from `plan.md` in sequential order

2. **Mark In Progress:** Before beginning work, edit `plan.md` and change the task from `[ ]` to `[~]`

3. **Write Failing Tests (Red Phase):**
   - Create a new test file for the feature or bug fix.
   - Write one or more unit tests that clearly define the expected behavior and acceptance criteria for the task.
   - **CRITICAL:** Run the tests and confirm that they fail as expected. This is the "Red" phase of TDD. Do not proceed until you have failing tests.

4. **Implement to Pass Tests (Green Phase):**
   - Write the minimum amount of application code necessary to make the failing tests pass.
   - Run the test suite again and confirm that all tests now pass. This is the "Green" phase.

5. **Refactor (Optional but Recommended):**
   - With the safety of passing tests, refactor the implementation code and the test code to improve clarity, remove duplication, and enhance performance without changing the external behavior.
   - Rerun tests to ensure they still pass after refactoring.

6. **Verify Coverage:** Run coverage reports:
   ```bash
   pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
   ```
   Target: >80% coverage for new code.

7. **Document Deviations:** If implementation differs from tech stack:
   - **STOP** implementation
   - Update `tech-stack.md` with new design
   - Add dated note explaining the change
   - Resume implementation

8. **Commit Code Changes:**
   - Stage all code changes related to the task.
   - Propose a clear, concise commit message e.g, `feat(converter): Add batch processing support`.
   - Perform the commit.

9. **Attach Task Summary with Git Notes:**
   - **Step 9.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-completed commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`).
   - **Step 9.2: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed summary for the completed task. This should include the task name, a summary of changes, a list of all created/modified files, and the core "why" for the change.
   - **Step 9.3: Attach Note:** Use the `git notes` command to attach the summary to the commit.
     ```bash
     # The note content from the previous step is passed via the -m flag.
     git notes add -m "<note content>" <commit_hash>
     ```

10. **Get and Record Task Commit SHA:**
    - **Step 10.1: Update Plan:** Read `plan.md`, find the line for the completed task, update its status from `[~]` to `[x]`, and append the first 7 characters of the *just-completed commit's* commit hash.
    - **Step 10.2: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.

11. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - **Action:** Stage the modified `plan.md` file.
    - **Action:** Commit this change with a descriptive message (e.g., `conductor(plan): Mark task 'Add batch processing' as complete`).

### Phase Completion Verification and Checkpointing Protocol

**Trigger:** This protocol is executed immediately after a task is completed that also concludes a phase in `plan.md`.

1.  **Announce Protocol Start:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the verification and checkpointing protocol has begun.

2.  **Ensure Test Coverage for Phase Changes:**
    -   **Step 2.1: Determine Phase Scope:** To identify the files changed in this phase, you must first find the starting point. Read `plan.md` to find the Git commit SHA of the *previous* phase's checkpoint. If no previous checkpoint exists, the scope is all changes since the first commit.
    -   **Step 2.2: List Changed Files:** Execute `git diff --name-only <previous_checkpoint_sha> HEAD` to get a precise list of all files modified during this phase.
    -   **Step 2.3: Verify and Create Tests:** For each file in the list:
        -   **CRITICAL:** First, check its extension. Exclude non-code files (e.g., `.json`, `.md`, `.yaml`).
        -   For each remaining code file, verify a corresponding test file exists.
        -   If a test file is missing, you **must** create one. Before writing the test, **first, analyze other test files in the repository to determine the correct naming convention and testing style.** The new tests **must** validate the functionality described in this phase's tasks (`plan.md`).

3.  **Execute Automated Tests with Proactive Debugging:**
    -   Before execution, you **must** announce the exact shell command you will use to run the tests.
    -   **Example Announcement:** "I will now run the automated test suite to verify the phase. **Command:** `pytest`"
    -   Execute the announced command.
    -   If tests fail, you **must** inform the user and begin debugging. You may attempt to propose a fix a **maximum of two times**. If the tests still fail after your second proposed fix, you **must stop**, report the persistent failure, and ask the user for guidance.

4.  **Propose a Detailed, Actionable Manual Verification Plan:**
    -   **CRITICAL:** To generate the plan, first analyze `product.md`, `product-guidelines.md`, and `plan.md` to determine the user-facing goals of the completed phase.
    -   You **must** generate a step-by-step plan that walks the user through the verification process, including any necessary commands and specific, expected outcomes.
    -   The plan you present to the user **must** follow this format:

        **For GUI Changes:**
        ```
        The automated tests have passed. For manual verification, please follow these steps:

        **Manual Verification Steps:**
        1.  **Run the application:** `python mts_converter_gui.py`
        2.  **Perform the action:** [specific action to test]
        3.  **Confirm that you see:** [expected outcome]
        ```

        **For CLI Changes:**
        ```
        The automated tests have passed. For manual verification, please follow these steps:

        **Manual Verification Steps:**
        1.  **Execute the command:** `python mts_converter.py <test_file.mts>`
        2.  **Confirm that:** [expected outcome]
        ```

5.  **Await Explicit User Feedback:**
    -   After presenting the detailed plan, ask the user for confirmation: "**Does this meet your expectations? Please confirm with yes or provide feedback on what needs to be changed.**"
    -   **PAUSE** and await the user's response. Do not proceed without an explicit yes or confirmation.

6.  **Create Checkpoint Commit:**
    -   Stage all changes. If no changes occurred in this step, proceed with an empty commit.
    -   Perform the commit with a clear and concise message (e.g., `conductor(checkpoint): Checkpoint end of Phase X`).

7.  **Attach Auditable Verification Report using Git Notes:**
    -   **Step 7.1: Draft Note Content:** Create a detailed verification report including the automated test command, the manual verification steps, and the user's confirmation.
    -   **Step 7.2: Attach Note:** Use the `git notes` command and the full commit hash from the previous step to attach the full report to the checkpoint commit.

8.  **Get and Record Phase Checkpoint SHA:**
    -   **Step 8.1: Get Commit Hash:** Obtain the hash of the *just-created checkpoint commit* (`git log -1 --format="%H"`).
    -   **Step 8.2: Update Plan:** Read `plan.md`, find the heading for the completed phase, and append the first 7 characters of the commit hash in the format `[checkpoint: <sha>]`.
    -   **Step 8.3: Write Plan:** Write the updated content back to `plan.md`.

9. **Commit Plan Update:**
    - **Action:** Stage the modified `plan.md` file.
    - **Action:** Commit this change with a descriptive message following the format `conductor(plan): Mark phase '<PHASE NAME>' as complete`.

10.  **Announce Completion:** Inform the user that the phase is complete and the checkpoint has been created, with the detailed verification report attached as a git note.
